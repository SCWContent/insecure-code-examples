# Insecure Code Examples

A set of insecure code examples for demo purposes.

## Injection

Injection is still the #1 Security Risk identified by OWASP.

- https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection

The [SQL Injection](src/test/java/sqlinjection) package contains examples for:

- How SQL Injection can be exploited.
- Sample code vulnerable to SQL Injection.
- Sample secured code.

## Sensei

If you have the [Secure Code Warrior Sensei plugin](https://securecodewarrior.com/sensei) installed then the `.sensei` folder Cookbook will have been installed, and you will see recipes for resolving SQL Injection, and helpers for JUnit 5.
